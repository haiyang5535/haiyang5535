ðŸ”¬ My main interest lies in leveraging data to solve real-world problems, from predictive modeling to data visualization.

## What I'm Working With

* **Data Science & ML:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R, SQL, Machine Learning (Regression, Classification), Statistical Analysis, Minitab
* **Full Stack & Tools:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Git & GitHub, MySQL, Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau
* **Currently Exploring:** Advanced data analytics techniques and building end-to-end data solutions.

## Featured Projects

* **Pacific Palisades Wildfire Spread Prediction:**
    * Analyzed 295 timestamped status rows of wildfire incident data (from an initial set of 344 records covering a 5-week period, Jan 7 - Feb 10, 2025), including containment percentage and personnel deployed, to forecast the eventual total acres burned.
    * Developed a regression model in R, utilizing these mid-incident reports, to predict the final fire size.
    * The model's goal is to help fire managers efficiently allocate resources by providing early estimates of the total land at risk.
* **Data Collection, Manipulation, and Visualization Tool:**
    * Scraped 1,000+ data points from websites using BeautifulSoup and Requests, generating customized categories for analysis.
    * Cleaned and standardized datasets using Pandas, significantly accelerating reporting cycles.
    * Produced interactive charts that facilitated rapid trend identification and decision-making.
