I'm a Mathematics-Statistics student at the University of Connecticut (graduating Dec 2025) with a strong passion for Data Science. I'm currently expanding my skill set as a Full Stack Developer, aiming to bridge the gap between data insights and impactful applications.
ðŸ”¬ My main interest lies in leveraging data to solve real-world problems, from predictive modeling to data visualization.

## What I'm Working With

* **Data Science & ML:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R, SQL, Machine Learning (Regression, Classification), Statistical Analysis, Minitab
* **Full Stack & Tools:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Git & GitHub, MySQL, Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau
* **Currently Exploring:** Advanced data analytics techniques and building end-to-end data solutions.

## Featured Projects

* **Pacific Palisades Wildfire Spread Prediction:**
    * Analyzed **295 timestamped status rows** of wildfire incident data (from an initial set of 344 records covering a 5-week period, Jan 7 - Feb 10, 2025), including containment percentage and personnel deployed[cite: 3, 6], to forecast the eventual total acres burned[cite: 4].
    * Developed a regression model in R, utilizing these mid-incident reports, to predict the final fire size[cite: 5, 6].
    * The model's goal is to help fire managers efficiently allocate resources by providing early estimates of the total land at risk[cite: 4, 5].
* **Data Collection, Manipulation, and Visualization Tool:** Built a tool to scrape 1,000+ data points using BeautifulSoup and Requests, clean it with Pandas, and create interactive visualizations.
