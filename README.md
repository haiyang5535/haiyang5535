I'm a Mathematics-Statistics student at the University of Connecticut (graduating Dec 2025) with a strong passion for Data Science. I'm currently expanding my skill set as a Full Stack Developer, aiming to bridge the gap between data insights and impactful applications.
ðŸ”¬ My main interest lies in leveraging data to solve real-world problems, from predictive modeling to data visualization.

## What I'm Working With

* **Data Science & ML:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R, SQL, Machine Learning (Regression, Classification), Statistical Analysis, Minitab
* **Full Stack & Tools:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Git & GitHub, MySQL, Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau
* **Currently Exploring:** Advanced data analytics techniques and building end-to-end data solutions.

## Featured Projects

* **Pacific Palisades Wildfire Spread Prediction:** Developed a model using Python, GIS, and machine learning to forecast high-risk wildfire zones with 80% accuracy. Integrated topographic, climate, and vegetation data.
* **Data Collection, Manipulation, and Visualization Tool:** Built a tool to scrape 1,000+ data points using BeautifulSoup and Requests, clean it with Pandas, and create interactive visualizations.
