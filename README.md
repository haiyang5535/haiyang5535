I'm a Mathematics-Statistics student at the University of Connecticut (graduating Dec 2025) [cite: 2] with a strong passion for Data Science. I'm currently expanding my skill set as a Full Stack Developer, aiming to bridge the gap between data insights and impactful applications.

ðŸ”¬ My main interest lies in leveraging data to solve real-world problems, from predictive modeling [cite: 8] to data visualization[cite: 10, 13].

## ðŸš€ What I'm Working With

* **Data Science & ML:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn [cite: 3]), R[cite: 3], SQL[cite: 3], Machine Learning (Regression, Classification [cite: 15]), Statistical Analysis[cite: 2, 14], Minitab [cite: 3]
* **Full Stack & Tools:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React[cite: 3], Git & GitHub[cite: 3], MySQL[cite: 3], Jupyter Notebooks[cite: 3], Tableau [cite: 3]
* **Currently Exploring:** Advanced data analytics techniques and building end-to-end data solutions.

## ðŸ”¥ Featured Projects

* **Pacific Palisades Wildfire Spread Prediction:** Developed a model using Python, GIS, and machine learning to forecast high-risk wildfire zones with 80% accuracy. [cite: 8]
* **Data Collection, Manipulation, and Visualization Tool:** Built a tool to scrape web data, clean it with Pandas, and create interactive visualizations. [cite: 11, 12, 13]
